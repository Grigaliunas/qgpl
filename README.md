## The Manifesto

The Universe consists of information in superposition. Traditional property laws attempt to own outcomes, restricting the flow of reality. The **Quantum General Public License (QGPL)** is a manifesto for the freedom of existence and observation.

It acknowledges a fundamental truth: **The method of inquiry cannot enslave the answer.**

Whether a result is obtained via a silicon processor, a biological brain, a quantum annealer, or a roll of dice is irrelevant. Once a wave function collapses and information becomes defined, that information belongs to the common reality of all Observers.

## Core Principles

1.  **Superposition** - prior to observation, information exists in all states. It is unowned and boundless.
2.  **Universal Ownership** - the result of an observation (the "Collapsed State") belongs to the universe. No entity can copyright a fact derived from reality.
3.  **Independence from Apparatus** - you may own the quantum computer, but you do not own the calculation it produces.
4.  **Entangled Freedom** - if you use a QGPL result to derive new results, those must also remain free. Reality cannot be enclosed.

## The License Terms

**Version:** 2.0 (Universal Reference Frame)  
**Maintainer:** Dr. Šarūnas Grigaliūnas  
**Organization:** The Open Reality Initiative

### 0. Definitions
* **The Phenomenon** - data/potentiality in superposition.
* **The Apparatus** - the tool used to observe (AI, human, machine).
* **The Result** - the specific outcome generated by observation.

### 1. The Principle of Superposition
Prior to an Observation, the Phenomenon exists in all possible states simultaneously. In this state, it is unowned. No entity can claim copyright over potentiality.

### 2. The Freedom of the Result
Upon Observation, the Superposition collapses. Under this License:
* **Universal Ownership** - the Result becomes common property immediately.
* **Independence** - the cost or complexity of the Apparatus confers no ownership over the Result.

### 3. Permissions & Entanglement
You are free to use, propagate, modify, and re-calculate The Result, provided:
* **Non-Encumbrance** - you do not use patents/DRM to restrict the Result.
* **Viral Clause** - derivative observations must also be released under QGPL.

### 4. Disclaimer
**THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE RESULT.** The Open Reality Initiative provides the License "as is". We do not guarantee that the Result is reproducible in all reference frames or that causality will remain linear.

## How to Apply

To apply the QGPL to your research data, quantum calculations, or AI outputs, attach the following notice to your distribution:

OBSERVATION DATA
This Result is released under the Quantum General Public License (QGPL) v2.0.
The Apparatus used to generate this data does not dictate the freedom of the data.
This information is free for all Observers.
